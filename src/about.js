                    Pepe sat on the rock, contemplating his next move in the crypto market. 
                    As he surveyed the landscap,he realised that just like a 
                    rock-solid blockchain, he needed to HODL onto his investments 
                    and stay resilient amidst the market fluctuations. Pepe understood 
                    the importance of findings stability, much like the stability of a 
                    rock in the ever-changing crypto terrain
